Description:
The project is supposed to be a descriptive model of the MVVM architecture, but unfortunately it was left unfinished during the working process at the university. Most of the time the project was getting committed from 1 PC by 2 people (including myself). I actively participated in this project, but unfortunately it is not clear which parts of it were done by me.
